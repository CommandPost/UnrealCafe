Today is day two (and the final day) of **Unreal Fest 2023** in the Gold Coast. Woohoo!

I'll be around at Unreal Fest all day, so if you see me, come and say "hi".

I'll continue to document the sessions I attend here. Enjoy!

**Sam Anderson** (Technical Marketing Manager @ Epic Games) just did an epic presentation that blew my mind.

I've never heard of **Twinmotion** before - but it looks AMAZING. It's been described as "Unreal Engine for Dummies", but it's actually basically a much more non-technical user friendly interface for Unreal Engine.

The schedule says:

> Twinmotion is a quick visualization tool with solutions for many. This talk will cover "Why Twinmotion?" and how the tool could fit nicely into creators' workflow. The session will include an introduction to Twinmotion as well as a deeper dive into the tools that Unreal developers can utilize including interoperability with the Epic ecosystem.

For us this is SUPER interesting, as it means non-technical users, such as directors, art directors, etc. would use Twinmotion for throwing stuff together on Mac, and then we can send across to PC to continue in Unreal Engine.

You can learn more about Twinmotion [here](https://www.twinmotion.com/en-US){target="_blank"}.

Here's some slides from the presentation, however the presentation was mostly a hands on demo. Sam was awesome - such a good presentation!
