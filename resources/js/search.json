Originally designed for the first-person shooter game \"Unreal,\" the Engine quickly garnered attention due to its cutting-edge graphics, robust networking, and extensibility. The Engine was released alongside the game, marking the start of its wide-scale use in video game development.","The first few iterations of Unreal Engine (Unreal Engine 1, 2, and 3) were mainly focused on improving the core technology and establishing the platform as a powerful tool for game development. While these iterations contributed significantly to the advancement of real-time 3D graphics in gaming, they also laid the groundwork for the Engine's later applications in film and television.","The release of Unreal Engine 4 in 2014 represented a significant leap forward. Its advanced graphical capabilities and accessible Blueprint visual scripting system expanded the potential user base beyond game developers to include designers, architects, and artists. This version of the engine also made significant strides in real-time rendering, a feature that would become critical for its adoption in the film industry.","The real revolution in terms of filmmaking came around 2016, when Epic Games launched a program called Unreal Engine for Education, aimed at schools and students in fields like animation and film. This initiative, alongside further enhancements in the Engine's cinematic tools, encouraged a new wave of artists and filmmakers to explore Unreal Engine as a viable tool for cinematic creation.","Since then, the film industry's use of Unreal Engine has grown rapidly. It has become an invaluable tool for previsualization (previz), allowing directors to explore and plan shots and sequences before actual filming. The Mandalorian, a Star Wars TV series that premiered in 2019, famously used Unreal Engine to create dynamic, real-time backdrops on set, effectively blurring the line between game technology and filmmaking.","Unreal Engine 5, announced in 2020 and released in 2021, pushed the envelope even further. With features like Lumen (a fully dynamic global illumination solution) and Nanite (a virtualized micropolygon geometry system), Unreal Engine 5 enabled unprecedented levels of detail and photorealism, furthering its applications in film production.","By 2023, Unreal Engine has not only revolutionized game design but has also significantly impacted the film industry. Its real-time rendering capabilities have transformed workflows, making it possible to create high-quality visual effects more quickly and cost-effectively. As a result, Unreal Engine has become a crucial tool for filmmakers looking to push the boundaries of what's possible in storytelling.","Want to contribute?

This way, you ensure that everyone's work meshes well together and the project doesn't become a mess.","A GitHub pull request is basically the same idea. When you're working on a shared codebase, or \"project,\" you often work on your own copy, or \"branch\". When you think your changes are ready to be added to the shared codebase, you make a \"pull request\". This is a proposal that says \"I think these changes I made should be added to our shared project\".","Your teammates then can look over your changes, suggest edits, and finally, if they agree that your changes are good, they \"merge\" them into the shared project.
